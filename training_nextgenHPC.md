  - take in the project description; support some educational courses and also some conference attendance
  - facilitator: assists researchers in leveraging ACI resources for themselves, rather than performing research tasks on ACI systems for or as a contributor to a speciic research project
  - 2-3 people for each of the cohorts
  - other complementary CIP roles: Research sorftware engineer and computational scientist
  - there is awareness that there are limits of human abilities

## DARSE

- remocratizing access to research softwrae engineering
